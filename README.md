# HORISEON - Marketing Agency / Code Refactor

## Descriptions

This repository contains the refactored code for a marketing agency's website to make it more accessible.  The website previously did not meet accessibility standards and lacked proper semantic tags in the HTML. Additionally, the CSS file was not structured optimally.

Ensuring web accessibility is crucial for companies and brands to provide equal opportunities for people with disabilities to access their websites.

The goal of this refactoring project is to enhance the website's accessibility without compromising its functionality and visual appearance. It is also important to note that people with disabilities can easily access the website using assistive technologies, such as screen readers and braille keyboards with this refactored version.
